Wireless Sensor Node

Introduction: 
Our project is called the Wireless Sensor Node. The goal of this project is to wirelessly 
transmit data from one location to another via Bluetooth. There is a plethora of uses for such a 
system. Our system is built primarily to detect forest fires. By providing early warning signs and
detecting the fire before it grows out of control, this system can help save many lives and prevent 
multiple tragedies. It can aid in protecting our natural resources and wild animals. This Wireless 
Sensor Node is apt to prevent all the wildfires occurring on the west coast. 
When used to detect forest fires, the device will be placed in multiple locations in the 
forest. Hence, it must be able to run indefinitely without a power source. Using a thermistor, we 
read the temperature at a certain location. We will use a mock solar panel to send power to our 
circuit. A DC/DC converter will be used to increase the power from the Solar Panel to reach the 
level needed to charge the battery. This battery is what will power our Arduino which reads and 
transmits the temperature data. We used a PWM to regulate the DC/DC converter in order to 
save power. We went above and beyond the requirements by developing an Android app that 
monitored the temperature.(See more detail in Final_report PDF)
